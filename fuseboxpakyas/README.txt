Fusebox 5.5 Skeleton Applications

Install the Fusebox 5.5 core files (see the Downloads section of fusebox.org).

Copy this (skeleton) directory into your webroot.

Test everything works by hitting these URLs in your browser:

	http://localhost/skeleton/traditional/
	
	http://localhost/skeleton/noxml/
	
Replace "localhost" with whatever is appropriate for your server.

The no-XML version requires Application.cfc support (ColdFusion MX 7 or later or compatible systems).
